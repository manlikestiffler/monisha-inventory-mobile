Absolutely! Let’s create a **comprehensive, fully detailed blueprint** for a **Monisha Inventory Management Mobile App** using **React Native (Expo), Tailwind CSS v3.3.2, and ShadCN UI**, based on your existing web system. I’ll include an essay-style introduction and detail every aspect of the mobile app.

# 📱 Monisha Inventory Management Mobile App – Complete Blueprint

## Introduction – The Mobile App Flow

The Monisha Inventory Mobile App is designed to extend the functionality of the existing web system to mobile devices, ensuring managers, staff, and administrators can efficiently manage uniforms, batches, and orders on the go. Just like the web system, the mobile app is **batch-first**, meaning all product management starts with batches of stock received.

When new uniforms arrive, they are recorded in **Batch Inventory**. Each batch contains the uniform type (e.g., “Boys’ Trousers”), available variants (sizes, colors, gender), and quantities. The mobile app ensures these batches are immediately available to staff for creating or updating **Product Inventory**.

In Product Inventory, users can only create products that exist in **Batch Inventory**, ensuring consistency and preventing errors. Sizes and variants shown are filtered based on actual batches, meaning you cannot sell or allocate a uniform size that does not physically exist in stock.

The mobile app links every product back to its originating batch, so stock movements are fully traceable. When an order is processed, stock quantities are updated in real-time, reflecting both the product-level and batch-level inventories.

The flow of the mobile app is essentially:

1. **Receive stock** → record it in **Batch Inventory**.
2. **Create products** in **Product Inventory** → only from available batch items.
3. **Process orders** → deduct quantities from batches using FIFO.
4. **Generate reports** → track stock, orders, and sales analytics.

This design ensures accuracy, accountability, and a professional workflow, even on mobile devices.

## 🔹 Database & Data Schema (Mobile-Oriented)

Mobile app will use the **same Firestore schema as the web system**, ensuring consistency.

* **Collections**: `uniforms`, `uniform_variants`, `batchInventory`, `schools`, `orders`, `users`.
* **Data relationships** remain the same:

```
uniforms (1) ←→ (N) uniform_variants ←→ (N) batchInventory.items
    ↓                    ↓                        ↓
Product Info      Selling Prices         Physical Stock
```

---

## 🔹 Authentication & Roles

* **Roles**: Super Admin, Manager, Staff (same as web system)
* **Mobile-specific**:

  * Biometric login (optional)
  * Keep token/session in secure storage
  * Role-based UI rendering (tabs/screens restricted based on role)

**Flow:**

```
User opens app → Firebase Auth → Fetch user profile → Load role-specific dashboard
```

---
